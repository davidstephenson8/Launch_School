### Local Variable Scope

### Example 1

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = “Hello”
b = a
a = “Goodbye”

puts a
puts b
```

The following code outputs the string object ``"Hello"`` followed by the string object ``"Goodbye"`` on the 
following line. It returns ``nil`` twice. The ``puts`` method outputs the object passed to it and returns ``nil``.
This happens because variables point independently to values in memory. The local variable ``b`` points to the
string object ``"Hello"`` not local variable ``a``. As a result, then the object that ``a`` points to changes,
the object that ``b`` points to remains the same.  

### Example 2

#What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = 4

loop do  
  a = 5  
  b = 3

  break
end

puts a
puts b
```

- this code returns ``nil`` once and outputs 4 and then throws an error when it attempts to pass b to the ``puts``
method. This is because the local variable ``b`` is not assigned to a value that's accessible outside of the 
block's scope.  

### Example 3

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = 4
b = 2

loop do  
  c = 3  
  a = c  
  break
end

puts a
puts b
```

### Example 4

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

  loop do    
    puts str    
    i -= 1    
    break if i == 0  
  end
end

example('hello')
```

### Example 5

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def greetings(str)  
  puts str  
  puts "Goodbye"
end

word = "Hello"
greetings(word)
