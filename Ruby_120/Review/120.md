# Classes and objects
## Classes
Classes are what define objects. They give the basics for what an object should contain and what it should be able to do (via methods). 
## Objects
Objects are specific instances of a class. They are created and given specific data that can be manipulated via the methods defined in the class. They're created via a pathway called instantiation. 

```ruby
class SwaggyP
end

Dave = SwaggyP.new
```

Instantiation is the creation of a specific instance of a class, or an object. It uses the class method ``new`` and executes anything inside of the ``initialize`` method definition found within the class. 

```ruby
class SwaggyP
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

dave = SwaggyP.new("Stanley")

dave.name # => "Stanley"
```

# Use attr_* to create setter and getter methods
## Setter methods
A setter method is a method that allows the value of an instance variable to be changed. The general syntax for a setter method is
as follows
```ruby
class NewPuppy
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name=(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```
The wild thing about Ruby is that it recognizes the syntax from ``name=(name)`` and allows the syntax

```ruby
sparky.name = "swagg"
```

In this example, assuming we'd initialized the object to something else already, the name would be reassigned to the string object ``"swagg"``

Setter methods also always return the value that the object was set to, regardless of anything else that was done in the method. 

## Getter methods
A getter method allows us to return the value of a given instance variable. 

```ruby
class NewPuppy
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name
    @name
  end
end
```

## attr to call getters and setters
However, this is a long way of defining things, so Ruby allows ``attr_accessor`` to take the place of a method definition like this for setting
the variable names. The syntax is as follows

```ruby
class SmallBird

attr_writer :name, :species

def initialize(name, species)
  @name = name
  @species = species
end
```

This code allows for a ``SmallBird`` object to be initialized and for the ``@name`` and ``@species`` instance variables to be accessed through ``name`` and ``species`` instance methods, respectively.  

similarly to the setter methods, there's an alternative syntax that you could use to get the values for these instance variables. 

```ruby
class SmallBird

attr_reader :name, :species

def initialize(name, species)
  @name = name
  @species = species
end
```

If you want to allow access to modify and to read the values, you can use ``attr_accessor`` and define both getter and setter methods in
one line of code. 

```ruby
class SmallBird

attr_accessor :name, :species

def initialize(name, species)
  @name = name
  @species = species
end
```
# How to call setters and getters
Outside of the class definition, you can call a setter by calling the method directly on the object. Within the class definition, you can call
the getter method to access whatever information you're interested in. This is useful for dealing with data that you want to modify before making it 
available. Stuff like social security numbers or bank accounts. As an example

```ruby
class BankAccount
  def initialize(number, holder_name)
    @number = number.to_s
    @holder_name = holder_name
  end

  def number #I'm sure there's a cuter way to do this
    xes = @number[0..-5].split("").map do |digit|
      "X"
    end
    xes.join + @number[-4..-1]
  end
end
```
calling the number method within the class allows us to access this number without exposing the entire bank account number.

```ruby
def to_s
  "The account number is #{number}"
end
```

This code would return the result of the call to the number instance method instead of exposing ``@number`` directly. It also allows for easy modification of the number format if changes need to be made in the future.

Using these instance methods doesn't always work however. There are some contexts where Ruby will think that you're just trying to initialize local variables. For more about this concept see [calling methods with self](#calling-methods-with-self)
# Instance variables, class variables, and constants, including the scope of each type and how inheritance can affect that scope
## instance variables
These are vairables that exist as long as the variable exists. They're defined inside of methods within the class definition. They start with a ``@`` and are all lowercase.
### scope and how inheritance affects scope
They are scoped at the object level, so even though they're defined inside of ``initialize`` or other methods, they're accessible to other methods within the object. 

instance variables initialized in superclasses of a given object are accessible to that object. These values are not directly inherited by the subclass objects, however. They're modified in the parent class and then accessed in the subclass. Instance variables do need to be intitialized before they're accessed, and sometimes this is where programs can run into trouble. 
## class variables
These are variables that are scoped for an entire class. They start with a ``@@`` and are all lowercase afterwards. They're scoped at the class level, in contrast to instance variables, which are scoped at the object level. Class and instance methods can access and modify class variables. 
### scope and how inheritance affects scope
these are scoped to the class, and are accessible to any object of that class.

They're also accessible to sub-classes. This can lead to unexpected behavior, because if a class variable is modified in one sub-class, it affects class variable in the super-class too. This can lead to unexpected results, as illustrated below. 

```ruby
class Animal
  @@legs = 4
  
  def self.legs
    @@legs
  end
end

class Human < Animal
  @@legs = 2
end

Animal.legs #returns 2
Human.legs #returns 2

class Cheetah < Animal
end

Cheetah.legs
```

So, be aware of this quirk and be cautious!
## constants
These are values that should remain consistent throughout the entire class. These are defined in all caps in the body of the class definition. To resolve a constant reference, Ruby first looks at lexical scope, and then works up the inheritance tree. Thus, constants defined in an unrelated class are inaccessible to other classes. However, using the syntax ``ClassName::CONSTANT`` you can pull the value of a constant from an unrelated class, which isn't possible with class or instance variables. 
### scope and how inheritance affects scope
Constants are accessible to subclasses of class where they are defined, and to any method within the lexical scope of the constant. However, lexical scope does not include the main scope. So constants defined outside of a class (the main scope) are the last place that Ruby looks for a value when resolving a constant reference. So, Ruby first looks at lexical scope, which doesn't include the main scope, then the inheritance tree, then finally it looks in the main scope. 

HOW INHERITANCE AFFECTS SCOPE?!?
# Instance methods vs. class methods
self is used when defining class methods. Writing code like
```ruby
def self.what_am_i
  "I'm a cutie pie"
end
```
would let the ``what_am_i`` method be called on the class and would return the value in the method.

Intance methods are defined inside of the class without using self, and can be called on objects of the given class, but not on the class itself.
# Method Access Control
In Ruby, methods can be defined as accessible to anyone who knows the class or object name, or public, protected, or available only to other instances of the class, or private, meaning the method can only be used in this specific instance of the class. These methods are only accessible from within the class, not to outside calls. Public methods comprise the class's interface. The following code has examples of each of these concepts.

```ruby
class BasketballTeam
  attr_reader :name, :ranking #these are public methods, because it can be called on an instance of the BasketballTeam object and returns the name of the team or the ranking
  
  def initialize(name, ranking, favorite_team)
    @name = name
    @ranking = ranking
    @favorite_team = favorite_team
  end

  private

  def change_ranking(game_result)  #this method changes the ranking based on a game result, and wouldn't be able to be called on instances, it could only be used from within the method to modify ranking. (this is a little half baked, there isn't a way to get game results from outside the instance, but works for our purposes)
    if game_result = "W"
      game_result = 1
    elsif game_result = "L"
      game_result = -1
    end
    @ranking = ranking - game_result
  end

  protected

  attr_reader :favorite_team # This would allow other instances of the class to see whether or not another instance was the favorite team, but wouldn't allow a user to check to see if a team was your favorite or not. Pretty handy! 
```
# Referencing and setting instance variables vs. using getters and setters

????

Referencing an instance variable directly can expose data that we don't want to be public. 
# Class inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
## class inheritance
One class (called a subclass) inherits the behaviors of another class (called a superclass) 
## encapsulation
Encapsulation is the compartmentalization of different functions in object oriented programming. Different functionalities are hidden and making it unavailable to the rest of the code base. In Ruby, objects are created to hide these functionalities and methods are used to interact with the objects as needed. As a result, instance variables are assigned to a value, but can only be accessed or modified if their classes given getter and setter methods. The values local variables refer to are always accessible and can be modified. 
## polymorphism
This is the ability of different objects to respond to the same methods in different ways. So a cat object, an octopus object and a bird object would all respond to the ``#move`` method in different ways depending on how their respective methods were programmed. This is typically accomplished through inheritance. 

```ruby
class Animal
  def move
  end
end

class Fish < Animal
  def move
    puts "swim"
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
  def move
    puts "walk"
  end
end

# Sponges and Corals don't have a separate move method - they don't move
class Sponge < Animal; end
class Coral < Animal; end

animals = [Fish.new, Cat.new, Sponge.new, Coral.new]
animals.each { |animal| animal.move }
```

In this example, the client code (the code that uses the objects) is able to treat each object as a generic animal (something that can move), even though each object is its own separate class. This is because each class inherits from Animal and thus is able to respond to move. So this is polymorphism through inheritance, the most typical way polymorphism is inherited. 
## duck typing
"if an object quacks like a duck it is a duck." 

These are objects that have similar behaviors not through class inheritance or shared modules but they all have methods with the same name that accept the same number of objects. 

Here's Launch's example for duck typing

```ruby
class Wedding
  attr_reader :guests, :flowers, :songs

  def prepare(preparers)
    preparers.each do |preparer|
      preparer.prepare_wedding(self)
    end
  end
end

class Chef
  def prepare_wedding(wedding)
    prepare_food(wedding.guests)
  end

  def prepare_food(guests)
    #implementation
  end
end

class Decorator
  def prepare_wedding(wedding)
    decorate_place(wedding.flowers)
  end

  def decorate_place(flowers)
    # implementation
  end
end

class Musician
  def prepare_wedding(wedding)
    prepare_performance(wedding.songs)
  end

  def prepare_performance(songs)
    #implementation
  end
end
```

So each class responds to ``prepare_wedding`` but the implementation depends on each individual classes' methods. Intention is important when considering if a method is polymorphic or not. For example, a potato object that has a mash method and a monster object that have a mash method probably wouldn't be considered polymorphic because they have two different, incompatible functions. Unless you're throwing a monster party. 

# Modules
An alternative to inheritance for achieving polymorphism. A module contains specific behaviors that can be shared between classes without following a superclass subclass structure like what's required with inheritance. Modules are incorporated into different classes via mixins. 

```ruby
module Sing
  def sing(sound)
    puts sound
  end
end

class Soprano
  include Sing
end

class Bass
  include Sing
end

karen = Soprano.new
karen.sing("MAKING HIGH SOUNDS")        # => MAKING HIGH SOUNDS
bob = Bass.new
bob.sing("MAKING LOW SOUNDS")         # => MAKING LOW SOUNDS
```

It's basically like we copy pasted the ``sing`` method into the ``Soprano`` and ``Bass`` classes. 
# Method lookup path
When a method is called on an object, Ruby follows a predictable path to look for the method definition. First it looks in the object's class, and if it 
finds a method with the name of the calling method in the object's class it stops looking. If no method is found in the original class, Ruby then
looks in any modules that have been mixed into the class, and then moves onto each respective superclass. 

The ``ancestors`` method can be used to check the method lookup path when called on the class. 

```ruby
puts String.ancestors 

=begin
String
Comparable
Object
PP::ObjectMixin
Kernel
BasicObject
is the output for this method call
=end
```

The lookup path will look for methods in modules in the reverse order that they were mixed into the class. Or in other words, the modules that are mixed in last in the class will be investigated first for any method calls. In addition, any modules mixed into the superclass of a given class will also be searched for methods after the class is investigated. 
# self
``self`` is a reserved keyword that refers to the object that called it. 
# Calling methods with self
Methods should be called with self when there's some kind of ambiguity that could cause Ruby to misinterpret your intention. Assume you have a class set up with getter and setter methods for the instance variables, but you want to be able to reassign all of these variables together in on big method call. If you wrote syntax like this

```ruby
  def change_info(q, e, d)
    quod = q
    erat = e
    demonstrandum = d
  end
```

Then ruby would assume that you were assigning some local variables to the values assigned to q e and d. So a call to self is necessary here. 

```ruby
  def change_info(q, e, d)
    self.quod = q
    self.erat = e
    self.demonstrandum = d
  end
```

This syntax correctly calls the setter methods for each of these instance variables and allows them to be modified as intended. 

# More about self
``self`` is used in two different contexts, class method definitions and calling setter methods from within the class. What self refers to is contextual. When used in an instance method within a class, it references the calling object. When used within the class, it references the class. So, in a hypothetical where we had a class named ``BigCars`` and an instance named ``fordf150``, ``self`` would refer to ``fordf150`` if it were called in an instance method, and the method call would return the value associated with ``weight``. Contrastingly, ``self`` would refer to ``BigCars`` if there were a class variable called ``numberofbigcars`` in ``self.numberofbigcars``. So outside of an instance method, ``self`` references the class. Inside of an instance method, ``self`` references the object that the instance method is being defined in.

# Fake operators and equality
## Fake operators
See [here](https://launchschool.com/lessons/d2f05460/assignments/9a7db2ee) for a table of all of the different fake and not fake operators in Ruby. ``[]`` and ``[]=`` are some of the most surprising operators that are actually methods, but ``+`` ``-`` ``*`` ``<<``, etc, are all actually methods as well.

If the ``[]`` were written out without any syntactical sugar it would look something like ``array.[](2)`` to access the third element of the array. The element assignment in an array is even wilder. ``array.[]=(2, "ayyy")``. This would reassign the third element in an array to ``ayyy``.

``&&`` ``||`` ``..`` ``...`` ``? :`` ``.`` ``::`` and all of the variations of ``=`` (``-=`` ``*=``, etc.) are all actually operators. 
## Equality
``==`` for most objects compares the values. ``==`` is actually a method and built in Ruby classes provide their own version of this class. There is a ``BasicObject#==`` that ends up being called when a class doesn't have its own ``==`` method. It only returns true when two objects are the same object.
